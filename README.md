ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Hydegustaman
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming and coding, well all sort of tech things too.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning coding with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (combined).
ðŸ“« If happens when you find my codes has an error, or lack of creativity, or maybe has similarity with someone else's code feel free to email me at eggustaman1981@outlook.com I'll be happy to respons it.
 ...

Now, about this project. 

I call it # iPhone-14-Screen-Gradient-Mock-Up #
Another mockup for newly iPhone 14. This time, we play with color-gradient.
When the first time you click the HTML file, it will shows the iPhone in standby-mode. Try to click the left and right button to turn on the screen.
My aplogize, the cursor still in arrow shape (not pointer). Something miss in my CSS file. Can you do me a favor to change it..? Thanks beforehand.

Have A Nice Day!!
